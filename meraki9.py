# Question (Part 1)
# Write a function named check_numbers which takes two numbers 
# and then print "both are even" if both numbers are even (divide by 2)
# otherwise print "both numbers are not even".

# def check_numbers(num1,num2):
#     if num1%2==0 and num2%2==0:
#         print(" Both are even")
#     else:
#         print(" both are not even")
# check_numbers(4,6)







# Question (Part 2)
# Now write a function named check_numbers_list
# Which takes the list of an integer as a argument and then checks
# whether both the integers with the same index are even or not.

# To check this, use the check_numbers function written in the previous Part 1.

# def check_numbers_list(list1,list2):
#     i=0
#     while i<len(list1 and list2):
#         if list1[i]%2==0 and list2[i]%2==0:
#             print(" Both are even")
#         else:
#             print(" both are not even")
#         i+=1
# check_numbers_list([2, 6, 18, 10, 3, 75],[6, 19, 24, 12, 3, 87] )
