# Question (Part 2)
# Write the code of a function named list_change which take 2 lists 
# as integer arguments and then multiply the items of those lists which 
# are on the same index number (order) and get them to return a new list.
# You have to use calculator function to multiply. Can't multiply normally.

# def list_change(list1,list2):
#     i=0
#     c=[]
#     while i<len(list1):
#         b=list1[i]*list2[i]
#         c.append(b)
#         i+=1
#     print(c)
# list_change([5, 10, 50, 20], [2, 20, 3, 5])
