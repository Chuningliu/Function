# Write a function named add_numbers which takes two numbers as arguments and 
# then prints their sum. The name of the arguments should be number1 and number2.


# def add_numbers(num1,num2):
#         sum=num1+num2
#         print(sum)
# add_numbers(56,12)


# Question (Part 2)
# Write a function named add_numbers_list which takes 2 lists of 
# two integers and then prints the sum of the integers with the same position.
# Use the add_numbers function given in Part 1 to count 2 integers that have
# the same position.
# If we give [50, 60, 10] and [10, 20, 13] to this function it will print this
# 60
# 80
# 23


# def add_numbers_list(list1,list2):
#     i=0
#     while i<len(list1 and list2):
#         sum=list1[i]+list2[i]
#         i+=1
#         print(sum)
# add_numbers_list([50,60,10],[10,20,13])
